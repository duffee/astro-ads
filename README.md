# astro-ads
Perl interface to the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) abstract service


## Getting Started

1. You'll need an API key from NASA ADS labs. Sign up for the newest version of ADS search at https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu, visit account settings and generate a new API token. The official documentation is available at https://github.com/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api

2. When you get your API key, save it to a file called ~/.ads/dev_key or save it as an environment variable named ADS_DEV_KEY

3. From a terminal type `cpan install Astro::ADS`
