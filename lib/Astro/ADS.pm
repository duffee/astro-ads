=head1 NAME

Astro::ADS - Perl library to connect with the Harvard Astrophysical Data Service

=head1 VERSION

version 1.90

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $client = Astro::ADS->new({
        proxy => '...', # your web proxy
    });

    my $search = $client->search( q => 'star', fl => 'bibcode' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Harvard Astrophysics Data System (ADS) is a digital library
portal for researchers in astronomy and physics, maintaining
large bibliographic collections. Through the ADS, you can search
abstracts and full-text of major astronomy and physics publications.

Astro::ADS is the base class for accessing the ADS API using Perl
and will grow as more services are added.

It handles methods common to all services such as setting the UserAgent and
including your API key in all request headers.

=head2 Getting Started

If you don't have one already, you will need to register an
L<ADS account|https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/account/register> .
Generate an L<API token|https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/settings/token> and
put it in an environment variable named C<ADS_DEV_KEY> or in a file under your
home directory, B<~/.ads/dev_key>.
